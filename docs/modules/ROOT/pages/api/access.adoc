= Access Control

This directory provides ways to restrict who can access the circuits of a contract or when they can do it.

- `<<AccessControl,AccessControl>>` provides a per-contract role based access control mechanism. Multiple hierarchical roles can be created and assigned each to multiple accounts within the same instance.

- `<<Ownable,Ownable>>` is a simpler mechanism with a single owner "role" that can be assigned to a single account. This simpler mechanism can be useful for quick tests but projects with production concerns are likely to outgrow it.

- `<<ZOwnablePK,ZOwnablePK>>` provides a privacy-preserving single owner access control mechanism using cryptographic commitments. The owner's public key is never revealed on-chain, instead storing only a commitment that proves ownership without exposing identity, suitable for applications requiring administrative control with strong privacy guarantees.

== Core

[.contract]
[[AccessControl]]
=== `++AccessControl++` link:https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/compact-contracts/tree/main/contracts/accessControl/src/AccessControl.compact[{github-icon},role=heading-link]

[.hljs-theme-dark]
```ts
import "./node_modules/@openzeppelin-compact/contracts/src/access/AccessControl";
```

Roles are referred to by their `Bytes<32>` identifier. These should be exposed in the top-level contract and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by using `export sealed ledger` hash digests that are initialized in the top-level contract:

```typescript
import CompactStandardLibrary;
import "./node_modules/@openzeppelin-compact/contracts/src/access/AccessControl"
  prefix AccessControl_;

export sealed ledger MY_ROLE: Bytes<32>;

constructor() {
  MY_ROLE = persistentHash<Bytes<32>>(pad(32, "MY_ROLE"));
}
```

To restrict access to a circuit, use <<AccessControl-assertOnlyRole,assertOnlyRole>>:
```typescript
circuit foo(): [] {
  assertOnlyRole(MY_ROLE);
  ...
}
```

Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.

By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using <<AccessControl-_setRoleAdmin, _setRoleAdmin>>. To set a custom `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, implement the `Initializable` module and set `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` in the `initialize()` function.

WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure accounts that have been granted it.

TIP: For an overview of the module, read the {accessControl-guide}.

[[ZOwnablePK]]
=== `++ZOwnablePK++` link:https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/compact-contracts/blob/main/contracts/ownable/src/ZOwnablePK.compact[{github-icon},role=heading-link]

[.hljs-theme-dark]
```ts
import "./node_modules/@openzeppelin-compact/contracts/src/access/ZOwnablePK";
```

`ZOwnablePK` provides a privacy-preserving access control mechanism for contracts with a single administrative user. Unlike traditional `Ownable` implementations that store or expose the owner's public key on-chain,
this module stores only a commitment to a hashed identifier derived from the owner's public key and a secret nonce.
For the strongest security guarantees, use an {agpk}.

Ownable provides a basic access control mechanism where an account (an owner) can be granted exclusive access to specific circuits.

This module includes <<ZOwnablePK-assertOnlyOwner,ZOwnablePK-assertOnlyOwner>> to restrict a circuit to be used only by the owner.

TIP: For an overview of the module, read the {zownablepk-guide}.

[.contract-item]
[[ZOwnablePK-initialize]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++initialize++#++(initialOwner: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>) → []++` [.item-kind]#circuit#

Initializes the contract by setting the initial owner via `ownerId`
and storing the `instanceSalt` that acts as a privacy additive
for preventing duplicate commitments among other contracts implementing `ZOwnablePK`.

NOTE: The `ownerId` must be calculated prior to contract deployment.
See <<ZOwnablePK-_computeOwnerId,ZOwnablePK-_computeOwnerId]>>

Requirements:

- Contract is not already initialized.
- `ownerId` is not an empty array.

Constraints:

- k=14, rows=14933

[.contract-item]
[[ZOwnablePK-owner]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++owner++#++() → Bytes<32>++` [.item-kind]#circuit#

Returns the current commitment representing the contract owner.
The full commitment is: `SHA256(SHA256(pk, nonce), instanceSalt, counter, domain)`.

Requirements:

- Contract is initialized.

Constraints:

- k=10, rows=57

[.contract-item]
[[ZOwnablePK-transferOwnership]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++transferOwnership++#++(newOwnerId: Bytes<32>) → []++` [.item-kind]#circuit#

Transfers ownership of the contract to `newOwnerId`.
`newOwnerId` must be precalculated and given to the current owner off chain.

Requirements:

- Contract is initialized.
- Caller is the current contract owner.
- `newOwnerId` is not an empty array.

Constraints:

- k=16, rows=39240

[.contract-item]
[[ZOwnablePK-renounceOwnership]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++renounceOwnership++#++() → []++` [.item-kind]#circuit#

Leaves the contract without an owner.
It will not be possible to call <<ZOwnablePK-assertOnlyOwner,ZOwnablePK-assertOnlyOwner>> circuits anymore.
Can only be called by the current owner.

Requirements:

- Contract is initialized.
- Caller is the current owner.

Constraints:

- k=15, rows=24442

[.contract-item]
[[ZOwnablePK-assertOnlyOwner]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++assertOnlyOwner++#++() → []++` [.item-kind]#circuit#

Throws if called by any account whose id hash `SHA256(pk, nonce)` does not match the stored owner commitment.
Use this to only allow the owner to call specific circuits.

Requirements:

- Contract is initialized.
- Caller's id (`SHA256(pk, nonce)`) when used in <<ZOwnablePK-_computeOwnerCommitment,ZOwnablePK-_computeOwnerCommitment>> equals the stored `_ownerCommitment`,
thus verifying themselves as the owner.

Constraints:

- k=15, rows=24437

[.contract-item]
[[ZOwnablePK-_computeOwnerCommitment]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++_computeOwnerCommitment++#++(id: Bytes<32>, counter: Uint<64>) → Bytes<32>++` [.item-kind]#circuit#

Computes the owner commitment from the given `id` and `counter`.

**Owner ID (`id`)**

The `id` is expected to be computed off-chain as: `id = SHA256(pk, nonce)`

- `pk`: The owner's public key.
- `nonce`: A secret nonce scoped to the instance, ideally rotated with each transfer.

**Commitment Derivation**

`commitment = SHA256(id, instanceSalt, counter, domain)`

- `id`: See above.
- `instanceSalt`: A unique per-deployment salt, stored during initialization.
This prevents commitment collisions across deployments.
- `counter`: Incremented with each ownership transfer, ensuring uniqueness even with repeated `id` values.
Cast to `Field` then `Bytes<32>` for hashing.
- `domain`: Domain separator `"ZOwnablePK:shield:"` (padded to 32 bytes) to prevent hash collisions
when extending the module or using similar commitment schemes.

Requirements:

- Contract is initialized.

Constraints:

- k=14, rows=14853

[.contract-item]
[[ZOwnablePK-_computeOwnerId]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++_computeOwnerId++#++(pk: Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>, nonce: Bytes<32>) → Bytes<32>++` [.item-kind]#circuit#

Computes the unique identifier (`id`) of the owner from their public key and a secret nonce.

**ID Derivation**
`id = SHA256(pk, nonce)`

- `pk`: The public key of the caller.
This is passed explicitly to allow for off-chain derivation, testing, or scenarios
where the caller is different from the subject of the computation.
We recommend using an {agpk}.
- `nonce`: A secret nonce tied to the identity.
This value should be randomly generated and kept private.
It may be rotated periodically for enhanced unlinkability.

The result is a 32-byte commitment that uniquely identifies the owner.
This value is later used in owner commitment hashing,
and acts as a privacy-preserving alternative to a raw public key.

NOTE: This module allows ownership to be tied to an identity commitment derived from a public key and secret nonce.
While typically used with user public keys,
this mechanism may also support contract addresses as identifiers in future contract-to-contract interactions.
Both are treated as 32-byte values (`Bytes<32>`).

Requirements:

- Contract is initialized.
- `pk` is not a ContractAddress.

[.contract-item]
[[ZOwnablePK-_transferOwnership]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++_transferOwnership++#++(newOwnerId: Bytes<32>) → []++` [.item-kind]#circuit#

Requirements:

- Contract is initialized.
